# Sample-Website
## Purpose
This repository is designed so that club members can collaborate on building an original website template that can be used as a starting point for a personal web page. Since the goal is for this to be an example, please make sure that you add comments to what you write (or add comments for someone else who's forgotten). [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is a part of the repository to provide a way to create responsive elements.
